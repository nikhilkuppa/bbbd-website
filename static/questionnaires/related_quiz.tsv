type	question	option1	option2	option3	option4
memory	How many people have ever lived and to what is it more/less comparable?	107 billion people have ever lived, which is more than the number of stars present in the milky way	107 billion people have ever lived, which is more than the number of sand grains in Australia	100 billion people have ever lived, which is more than the number of atoms in a pound of gold	100 billion people have ever lived, which is more than the number of grams in the sun
memory	Why is the total number of ancestors much smaller than the actual math tells us?	Because of inbreeding	Because every human shares an ancestor around 3000 years ago	Because we all come from the same lineage, originated from Africa	Because humanity started with a big population
memory	How much of the human DNA is coded into proteins?	0.02	0.8	0.98	0.3
memory	How would you estimate how much time has passed since the beginning of humanity?	Locate and identify genetic changes in DNA i.e. mutations	Locate and identify changes in cells from the mother that are passed to every offspring	By doing whole genome sequencing	It's not possible because the human DNA has mutated too much
memory	Do humans have a higher genetic variance than i.e. group of zebras that live together?	No, because the original population was small	Of course, just look at the different looks that people have, which is directly correlated to their genetics	Yes, because our chromosomes recombine during reproduction	No, because our chromosomes don't recombine during reproduction
memory	How big is the DNA?	46 chromosomes and 6 billion base pairs	46 chromosomes and 4 billion base pairs	24 chromosomes and 6 billion base pairs	24 Chromosomes and 4 billion base pairs
memory	What does SNPs stand for and how frequent do they happen?	Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and 1/1000 base pairs	Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and 1/100 base pairs	Single Nuclear Polymorphism and 1/100 base pairs	Single Nuclear Polymorphism and 1/1000 base pairs
memory	What is the most adequate tool to detect how close or distant related we are from each other?	Genetic changes in general	Mutations	SNPs	Mitochondrial DNA
memory	What is the most adequate tool to detect the geographical origin of your ancestors?	SNPs	Mutations	Genetically changes in general	Mitochondrial DNA
memory	What is the most adequate tool to detect from which Homo Sapiens lineage we originated from?	Mitochondrial DNA	SNPs	Mutations	Genetically changes in general
memory	From whom do you descend originally and how is it possible to find that out?	Mitochondrial Eve, because the mitochondria doesn't go through recombination when it's passed on to the offspring	Mitochondrial Eve, because the mitochondria goes through recombination when it's passed on to the offspring	Mitochondrial Eve, because the DNA doesn't go through recombination when it's passed on to the offspring	Eve, because the mitochondria doesn't go through recombination when it's passed on to the offspring
memory	How can SNPs be useful?	Be able to associate to a geographical location by comparing to other people	They can be used as a personal signature	They are genetically changes thereby we can use them to identify how long ago humanity started	Since they are localized in the mitochondrial DNA we can trace back to the original Homo Sapiens lineage
