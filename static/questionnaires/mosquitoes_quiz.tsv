type	question	option1	option2	option3	option4
memory	What is an example of targeted eradication of mosquitoes?	Genetically modifying mosquitoes	Eliminating harmful species of mosquitoes in an ecosystem	Eliminating mosquitoes only from ecosystems where there are harmful effects on humans	Usage of DDT
memory	How many types of mosquitoes exist and do all of them bite?	Around 3000 mosquito species and a couple of hundred bite	Around 3000 mosquito species and most of them bite	Around 30.000 mosquito species and a couple of hundred bite	Around 30.000 mosquito species and most of them bite
memory	Aedes Aegypti is the primary vector for:	Dengue	Yellow fever	Chickengunya	Malaria
memory	Anopheles is the primary vector for:	Malaria	Dengue	Yellow fever	Zika
memory	How does the self-limiting gene in A. Aegypti work?	Genetically modified males are released and by mating with females in the wild they pass on their modified genes to their offspring which subsequently die	Genetically modified males are released and by mating with females in the wild they pass on their modified genes to their offspring, which subsequently are sterile	Genetically modified females are released and by mating with males in the wild they pass on their modified genes not only to their offspring but also to the males, which subsequently die	Genetically modified females are released and by mating with males in the wild they pass on their modified genes to their offspring, which subsequently become sterile
memory	How could we limit transmission of malaria?	Genetically modified genes in mosquitoes, that kill the malaria parasite inside them, which leads to limited virus transmission and additionally those genes would be passed on to the next generation	Genetically modified females can kill the malaria parasite, which leads to limited malaria transmission and this feature can be passed on to their offspring which are subsequently sterile	Genetically modified males are released and by mating with females in the wild they pass on their modified genes to their offspring, which subsequently die	Genetically modified females are released and by mating with males in the wild, they pass on their modified genes not only to their offspring but also to the males, which subsequently die
memory	What does the Walbachia exactly do?	It's a bacteria that represses the dengue virus growth in mosquitoes	It's a bacterium that represses the malaria virus growth in mosquitoes	It's a virus that represses the dengue virus growth in mosquitoes	It's a fungus that represses the malaria virus growth in mosquitoes
memory	Which method is more appropriate if your intention is to kill a whole mosquito species?	Self-limiting gene A. Aegypti method	Modified genes in Anopheles method	Walbachia Anopheles method	Self-limiting genes Anopheles method
memory	Which method is more appropriate if you want to limit virus transmission?	Walbachia Anopheles method	Modified genes in Anopheles method	Self-limiting genes Anopheles method	Self-limiting gene A. Aegypti method
memory	What could be a side effect of the Walbachia method and why?	By mutating rapidly, the virus gets resistant against the bacterium	The virus coexists with the bacteria through symbiosis	By mutating rapidly, the bacterium gets resistant against the virus	There are no side effects
memory	What would happen if all mosquitoes disappeared?	Scientists are not in agreement as to whether there would be broad scale damage to our planet	This would result in permanent damage to many ecosystems	Ecosystems would adjust to accommodate the loss of mosquitoes	The answer depends on how slowly the mosquitoes disappear
memory	What is an example of a role that mosquitoes play in ecosystems?	They can be carriers of several types of viruses	They are a large part of the biomass	They pollinate certain plants	They are a major food source for birds
