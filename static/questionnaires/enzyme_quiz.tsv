type	question	option1	option2	option3	option4
memory	Which statement is incorrect?	The Enzyme is stable in every condition	The Enzyme decreases the activation barrier	The Enzyme catalyzes the reaction	The Enzyme increases the reaction rate
memory	What can alter the reaction rate of an enzyme?	Enzyme concentration	pH	Temperature	Substrate concentration
memory	If you have an enzyme with a pH optimum of 9 and it's in a solution with a pH of 12 what will happen?	Configuration changes and thereby efficiency decreases	Configuration changes and thereby efficiency increases	The pH change is not significant enough to cause any change in efficiency	The pH change is not significant enough to cause any change in efficiency, which leads to an increase of the reaction rate
memory	If you have an enzyme with a temperature optimum of 70 F and the room temperature is at 80 F what will happen?	Configuration changes and thereby efficiency decreases	Configuration changes and thereby efficiency increases	The temperature change is not significant enough to cause any change in efficiency	The temperature change is not significant enough to cause any change in efficiency, which increases the reaction rate
memory	If you have two containers, both with a substrate concentration of 10 uM, but container 1 has an enzyme concentration of 10 uM and container 2 has an enzyme concentration of 14 uM, what will be the reaction rate?	The same in both containers	Container 1 will be faster than container 2	Container 2 will be faster than container 1	There will be no reaction in either
memory	If you have two containers, both with a substrate concentration of 10 uM, but container 1 has an enzyme concentration of 10 uM and container 2 has an enzyme concentration of 6 uM, what will be the reaction rate?	Container 1 will be faster than container 2	Container 2 will be faster than container 1	They both increase equally	There will be no reaction in either
memory	What of the following describes how an enzyme facilitates a reaction?	It lowers the activation energy of the reaction	It introduces another pathway for the reaction to occur	It adds energy to the system	It raises the activation energy of the reaction
memory	How would a graph look like if on the x-axis you have increasing substrate concentration and on the y-axis you have increasing reaction rate (enzyme concentration stays constant)?	Increases linearly until a little before saturation is reached	Increases exponentially until saturation is reached	It will look like a hyperbola	Increases linearly
memory	What happens when a molecule goes from an alcohol to an aldehyde?	The oxygen and hydrogen bond differently in each molecule	There is an additional oxygen atom added to each molecule	There is an additional hydrogen atom added to each molecule	The molecules break into multiple parts
memory	What is the value of the activation energy in the example shown in the graph?	3	7	4	5
memory	What could be a value for the activation energy if an enzyme would be involved in the reaction (use the graph)?	2	1	7	4
memory	Why is the reaction rate the same when the enzyme concentration is the same or higher than the substrate concentration?	Because of saturation	Because all the enzymes are occupied with a substrate 	Because of configurational changes	Because all substrates are occupied with an enzyme
