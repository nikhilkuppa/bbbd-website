memory	Why is a non-conductive material placed between two pieces of metal (capacitor)?	To prevent the two pieces of metal from touching each other	Charge Q can be stored because the circuit is thereby not complete	It increases the capacitance	Nothing happens since it has to be a conductive material to increase capacitance etc.
memory	What changes when the battery is taken out of the circuit?	Nothing happens	The charge Q decreases and the voltage V stays the same	Charge Q and voltage V increase	The voltage V decreases and the charge Q stays the same
memory	Mark the incorrect statement:	The negative charge of the molecules in a dielectric are attracted by the positive charged capacitor plate, which causes those molecules to travel towards that plate	The negative charge of the molecules in a dielectric are attracted by the positive charged capacitor plate, which leads to redistribution of the charge.	If there are already polarized molecules in a dielectric, those will align due to the charge on the capacitor plates	The polarization of the dielectric molecules leads to a voltage V decrease in a charged capacitor not in a circuit
memory	What happens to the dielectric molecules in between the capacitor plates?	Polarize, stretched molecules	Polarized, traveling molecules	Depolarized, stretched molecules	Hyperpolarized, traveling molecules
memory	How does the dielectric increase the capacitance in a circuit w/o a battery?	Decreases the voltage V by canceling the contribution of the charges across the plates with its polarized molecules	Increases voltage V across the capacitor plates through its polarized molecules	Decreases the charge Q of the capacitor plates through its polarized molecules	Increases charge Q of the capacitor plates though its polarized plates
memory	What happens when a dielectric is inserted in the capacitor which is in a circuit with a battery?	Charge Q increases	Charge Q decreases	Voltage V increases	Voltage V decreases
memory	What is the purpose of a battery in a circuit with a capacitor?	To obtain the same voltage V across the capacitor plates as the battery itself	To fully charge the capacitor plates	To maintain the charge Q constant	To increase the voltage V
memory	Consider 2 different capacitors where both have the same charge Q, but one has a bigger voltage V. How do their capacitances compare?	The one with the smaller voltage V has a smaller capacitance C	The one with the bigger voltage V has a bigger capacitance C	Both capacitors have the same capacitance C	It is not possible to have the same charge Q with different voltages V
memory	Consider 2 different capacitors where both have the same voltage V, but one has a smaller charge Q. How do their capacitances compare?	The one with the bigger charge Q has a bigger capacitance C	The one with the smaller charge Q has a bigger capacitance C	Both capacitors have the same capacitance C	It is not possible to have the same voltage V with different charges Q
memory	Why is the dielectric constant always >1?	Because it always increases the capacitance C	Because it always decreases the capacitance C	Because it decreases the voltage V when hooked up to a battery	Because it increases the voltage V when hooked up to a battery
memory	Which of the following changes the dielectric constant k?	Neither the charge Q on the capacitor nor the voltage V of the battery	Charge Q on the capacitor	Voltage V of the battery	Both the charge Q of the capacitor and voltage V of the battery
memory	Which of the following changes the capacitance?	Dielectric material	Charge Q on the capacitor	Voltage V of the battery	Charge Q of the battery
