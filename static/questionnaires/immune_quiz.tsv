domain	Which of the following is NOT a function of the human body's immune system?	The immune system often causes one to contract the same illness a second time after warding off an infection.	The immune system attacks organisms and substances that invade body systems and cause disease.	The immune system is made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body.	The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism.
domain	Which of the following cells could be found in the human immune system:	Dendritic	Antibodies	Hair cells	All options are correct
domain	An antigen is a molecule capable of inducing an immune response on the part of the host organism,though sometimes antigens can be part of the host itself. Mark the one which is not an antigen	Antibodies	Bacteria	Virus	Fungi
domain	An autoimmune disorder occurs when a person's immune system mistakenly attacks their own body tissues.Which of the disorders below is NOT an autoimmune disorder?	Osteoporosis	Multiple sclerosis	Lupus	Asthma
domain	Mark the INCORRECT sentence about inflammation	Inflammation is a synonym for infection	Inflammation is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli	Inflammation involves immune cells, blood vessels, and molecular mediators	The function of inflammation is to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury and clear out tissues damaged
domain	Mark the INCORRECT sentence:	All germs are bad	Vaccines educate your immune system	Sleep deprivation can impact immunity	Your immune system can attack itself
domain	Which of the following options could be a possible cause for inflammation?	All options are correct	Physical injury, blunt or penetrating	Frostbite	Burn
domain	Which of the names below does NOT correspond to a type of inflammation?	Hekelitis	Rhinitis	Appendicitis	Dermatitis
domain	Mark the INCORRECT sentence about the immune system	Stress does not affect the way your immune system works	Your immune system can attack itself	Your immune system may suffer from lack of sleep	Disease symptoms are sometimes the result of your immune system doing its job
memory	Mark the option below that corresponds to a job that is NOT executed by the immune system.	Produce fungi	Produce antibodies	Kill enemies	Communicate
memory	Approximately how many body cells die fighting an infection?	Millions	Billions	Thousands	Hundreds
memory	What is the first cell type to intervene during a bacterial invasion?	Guard cells / macrophage	Memory cells	B-cells	Dendritic cells
memory	What is the main job of the macrophage cell?	To kill enemies	To cause inflammation	To activate cells	All  options are correct
memory	Approximately how long does it take bacteria to double its population in the bloodstream?	20 minutes	30 minutes	30 seconds	20 seconds
memory	When T-cells are born they go through a very difficult and complicated training process.  How many of them survive?	A quarter of them	Half of them	All of them	None of the options are correct
memory	Which of the following is INCORRECT about B-cells?	B-cells send chemical instructions to the rest of the immune system.	The B-cells are activated by the T-cells	The B-cells are considered a very powerful weapons factory	B-cells work so hard that they can literally die from exhaustion
memory	Mark the INCORRECT option about antibodies.	They are produced by the dendritic cells	They are engineered to bind to the  surface of a specific intruder	There are different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs	They flood the blood and saturate the body
memory	After the infection is wiped out most of the immune cells commit suicide. What are the cells that stay behind?	Memory cells	Dendritic cells	Macrophage cells	All options are correct
memory	B cells are prevented from dying by:	T cells	Antibodies	Helper B-cells	Any white cell
memory	Neutrophile cells commit suicide after __ in order to _______?	5 days; prevent them from causing too much damage	5 hours; avoid wasting resources	The invading bacteria is defeated; prevent them from causing too much damage	4 days; avoid wasting resources
memory	How long does it take for Dendritic cells to travel to the lymph nodes?	1 day	1 hour	12 hours	More than 2 days
