domain	Mark the INCORRECT sentence.	There is only one type of star	Stars consist of super hot gas, the composition of which is mostly hydrogen and helium	The sun is the closest star to Earth	On a clear night, you can see stars that are over a quadrillion miles away
domain	Light is a ….	Both a wave and a particle	Neither a wave nor a particle	Particle	Wave
domain	Stars usually ?	Emit light	Get light from another object	Star are defined by their shape and size, not by their light emittance	Absorb light and then emit it when the light source is gone
domain	What holds  a star together	Its own gravity	The gravity of the sun	The gravity of the universe	It is not known
memory	What are stars?	Big hot round balls of plasma	Dead meteorites	Big hot round balls of dust	None of the options
memory	What happens when light from a distant source passes through a small opening?	All options are correct	The passing light picks up an imprint of that opening	Its waves interfere with each other	Its waves are bounced or bent slightly
memory	How does a hexagon leave its imprint?	Dashed six-pointed star	Dashed four-pointed star	Concentric rings	Series of dashed dashes
memory	Why do we see stars as pointy?	Because the imperfection of our eyes leave this imprint on light	Because stars are really pointy	Because they are bright objects in a dark night sky	None of the options are correct

memory	What is the shape of stars in Hubble space telescope photos?	Four pointed	Concentric rings	Six pointed	Series of dashes
memory	What is the diffraction imprint of a circle?	Concentric rings	Dashed lines	4-pointed perpendicular lines	Dashed rings
memory	What causes “suture lines”?	Where the fibers that make up the eye’s lens meet	Health problems	Short-sightedness	All options are correct
memory	How do scientists test that individual suture lines are the cause of subject-specific diffraction patterns?	Shine a laser into people’s eyes	Measure the pattern of suture lines in an individual’s eyes	Compare left and right eye shapes	Photograph the iris patterns and compare to star shapes
