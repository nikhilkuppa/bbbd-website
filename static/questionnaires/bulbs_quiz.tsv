domain	Fill in the blanks: Light bulbs convert _______ energy into ________ energy.	electrical; light	electrical; chemical	kinetic; potential	All options are correct
memory	When was the incandescent light bulb created?	19th Century	18th Century	17th Century	20th Century
memory	The bulb does all of the following EXCEPT:	Increases the brightness of the light emitted	Allows the filament to produce light more efficiently	Prevents gas from escaping from inside the bulb	Prevents oxygen from reaching the filament
memory	What is the role of the halogen gas in halogen bulbs?	All options are correct	Keep the light bulb clean	Prevent the wire from burning out	Helps redeposit atoms back onto the filament
memory	Which gas exists in halogen light bulbs?	Hydrogen bromide	Mercury chloride	Nitrogen bromide	Nitrogen fluoride
memory	Why don’t vapor lamps need a fluorescent coating?	Because they emit mainly visible light	Because they don’t use gas	Because they don’t have a bulb	All options are correct
memory	What happens when the electrons bump into the mercury atoms in the fluorescent bulbs?	The energy of the collision makes the atoms get excited	The energy of the collision makes the atoms relax	The energy of the collision makes the atoms keep the inside of the bulb clean	The energy of the collision splits the atom and releases energy
memory	Which of the following statements best describes the reactions that emit light within a fluorescent tube?	Electrons in the electrical current collide with mercury gas atoms, causing the atoms to emit light in their excited state	Chlorine gas in the tubes excites the electrons in the electrical current to emit light	Chemical reactions cause the hydrogen atoms in the tube to collide with the electrons, which emit light in their excited state	None of the options are correct
memory	What is fluorescence?	The process of absorbing ultraviolet light and re-emitting it as more visible light	The process of converting electrical current into visible light	The process of capturing the atoms that evaporates of the filament and put them back where they belong	The process of keeping the inside of the bulb clean and clear
memory	Suppose you have a large warehouse or a street that you need to light, which one of the following would you use?	Vapor lamps	LED	Any light producing source	Halogens
memory	The LED semiconductors has 2 layers, one ____________ while the other ____________.	Provides electrons with a lot of energy, Provides a place for the electrons to relax	Provides tungsten atoms, Provides a place for the electrons relax	Provides electrons with a lot of energy, Provides a place for the electrons absorb energy	None of options are correct
memory	How does a crystal of semiconducting gallium interact to form light in an LED bulb? Choose the best answer.	Electrons are transported from one end of the diode to the other and emit light	Electrical current moves electrons from a relaxed state to an excited state, which results in light	Thermal energy transports the electrons from a higher state of energy to a lower state of energy, emitting light	None of the options are correct
