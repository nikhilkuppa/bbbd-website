memory	What is the amount of energy transferred by a force called?	Work	Power	Kinetic Energy	Joules
memory	Which of the following affect the work done on an object? 	Force on an object	Angle between force and motion by an object	Distance object moves	Mass of the object
memory	If a moving object feels a force in the negative direction while moving in the negative direction, the work done will be:	Positive	Negative	Zero	It depends
memory	A person pushes a box along a horizontal floor at a constant speed. The net work done on the box is:	Zero	Positive	Negative	It depends
memory	An ice skater pushes a sled on a frictionless frozen pond starting from rest and moving until the velocity of the sled is 4 m/s. To get the sled to move 8 m/s after moving the same distance, the skater would have to: 	Push more than twice as hard	Push harder but less than twice as hard	Push twice as hard	It is not possible
memory	A forklift moves a crate horizontally from one side of the warehouse to the other while driving slowly and steadily. During this process, is the work done by the forklift:	Zero	Positive	Negative	It depends
memory	A truck pushes a car a distance d with some force F. Suppose the truck instead pushes the same car the same distance but with twice the force. Which is true of the work done by the truck with the greater force?	The work done is twice as much	The work done is the same	The work done is half as much	The work done is zero
memory	Suppose that the net work done on an object is zero. Which of the following is possible?	The object is at rest or is moving at a constant speed	There is more than one force acting on the object	There is only a single force on the object	The object is slowing down or the object is speeding up
memory	Which of the following are correct? If the net work done on an object is positive, then...	The object is speeding up.	The object is slowing down.	The object is speeding up if it is moving in the positive direction but slowing down if it is moving in the negative direction.	The object is speeding up unless there is friction.
memory	Which of the following are correct? If the net work done on an object is negative, then...	The object is slowing down	The object is speeding up	The object is speeding up if it is moving in the negative direction but slowing down if it is moving in the positive direction.	There must be friction
memory	What is the work done by a 2N force acting in the positive direction on a 2kg object that moves 1 meter in the negative direction while moving with constant speed 3m/s?	-2 J	2 J	Zero	9 J
memory	What is the kinetic energy of a 2kg object after moving 1 meter in the negative direction with constant speed 3m/s while acted on by a 2N force in the positive direction?	9 J	2 J	Zero	-2 J
